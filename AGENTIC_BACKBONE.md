## North star
$1,000,000/month ARR. Every architectural decision ties back to closing deals on the platform.

## Tech stack
- Next.js 15 (App Router) running on Cloudflare Workers via `@opennextjs/cloudflare`
- Cloudflare D1 for deal records, leads, contacts, documents, calendar, agent jobs, events
- Cloudflare R2 for documents, voice notes, generated assets
- Cloudflare KV / Durable Objects (TBD for agent state, currently in-process)
- Cloudflare AI bindings for the Kimi 2.6 chat surface (`/api/agent/chat`)

## 7-Agent mapping (project-specific names)
The canonical 7 agents (Conductor, Research, Creative, Production, Distribution, Sales, Intelligence)
exist in this project under the following directories — names retained for historical reasons but
roles aligned per the canonical doc:

| Canonical    | Project folder                  | Decides                                             |
|--------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Conductor    | `agents/conductor/`             | Which cycle runs, when to escalate, autonomy gates  |
| Research     | `agents/intelligence/`          | Pipeline risk, forecast deltas, gap detection       |
| Creative     | `agents/communication/`         | Outbound drafts, follow-ups, voice/SMS responses    |
| Production   | `agents/documents/`             | Document assembly, template materialization         |
| Distribution | `agents/communication/` (split) | Channel selection, send timing                      |
| Sales        | `agents/sales/`                 | Lead qualification, nurture sequences, close timing |
| Intelligence | `agents/intelligence/`          | Revenue monitoring, gap escalation, win-rate analysis |

Additional folders (`agents/operations/`, `agents/payments/`, `agents/voice/`) wrap operational
surfaces and third-party tool boundaries. They remain first-class job owners in ADGA state contracts
so scheduling, payments, calls, and approvals can be audited directly, while the canonical 7-agent
mapping above remains the reasoning framework.

## Runtime job owner enum
Agent jobs may be owned by:

- `conductor`
- `sales`
- `intelligence`
- `documents`
- `operations`
- `communication`
- `payments`
- `voice`

This enum is locked in `cloudflare/state/agent-job.schema.json` and shared by prepared actions,
deal memory, record graph generation, and outcome rollups.

## State contract index
Backbone/state contracts live under `cloudflare/state/`:

- `prepared-action.schema.json` — approval lanes for agent-prepared work
- `record-graph.schema.json` — relationships across records
- `workspace-search.schema.json` — search/retrieval result shape
- `deal-memory.schema.json` — persistent deal context
- `agentic-outcomes.schema.json` — measurable agent work rollups
- `audit-log.schema.json` — append-only audit record shape
- `document.schema.json` — document metadata and R2 version boundary
- `calendar-event.schema.json` — calendar events and invite delivery
- `dealflow-map.schema.json` — map nodes, edges, positions, and resource bindings

## Skills (`skills/*.skill.md`)
- `lead-scoring` — owner: Sales — scores inbound leads against ICP
- `pipeline-risk` — owner: Intelligence — surfaces slipping deals
- `proposal-generation` — owner: Creative — drafts proposals from a deal record
- `battlecard-generation` — owner: Research — competitive context per deal
- `knowledge-summary` — owner: Research — summarizes uploaded docs
- `prepared-action` — owner: Conductor / Operations — queues approval-lane work
- `deal-memory` — owner: Sales / Conductor — maintains persistent deal context

## Suite route contract
`app/suite/routes.ts` is the single source of truth for every `/suite/*` URL — sidebar, breadcrumbs,
layout matching, and the MCP capability surface all read from this registry. Adding or renaming a
route is a one-line change there, not a series of hand-written page wrappers.

## Event bus
`lib/events/` (this project)
- `types.ts` — discriminated-union event catalog
- `bus.ts` — publish / subscribe / persist
- `subscriptions.ts` — wiring (which agent listens to which event)
- `autonomy.ts` — autonomy gate (hands_off / medium / hands_on)

Every action persists to the `events` table in D1 (append-only — see route hardening in
`app/api/agent/events/route.ts`).

## MCP surface
`mcp-server.ts` at root holds the canonical inventory generator. It's exposed through HTTP at:

- `GET  /api/mcp`                           — full inventory: server identity, routes, workspaces,
                                              actions, skills, tools, and live bus handler stats.
- `POST /api/mcp { tool, arguments }`       — dispatch a tool call. Admin-gated. Actions whose
                                              policy is `approval_required` return 202 with the
                                              next-step direction; `owner_only` returns 403; `auto`
                                              actions emit `agent_job.started` on the bus so the
                                              platform's own agents handle the work.

The inventory is generated from contracts — `app/suite/routes.ts` (route capabilities),
`app/suite/workspaces.ts` (per-workspace actions + policies), `skills/*.skill.md`. Adding a row
to any of those automatically widens the MCP surface — no separate registration step.

## Replay surface
- `GET /api/events/replay?from=ISO&to=ISO&event_type=X`   — windowed audit log access
- `GET /api/events/replay?dead_letter=1`                  — parked failed events
- Bus handlers that throw past `REPLAY_RETRY_BUDGET` (5) get parked in `event_dead_letter`
  with their last error, awaiting operator review. Migration `0014_event_delivery_tracking.sql`
  adds the supporting columns + table.
